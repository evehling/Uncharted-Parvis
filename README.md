# Uncharted: Parvis
  The title of this Uncharted-inspired minigame comes from Sir Francis Drake's motto, Sic Parvis Magna, (Parvis meaning 'small') that is central to the plot line of the series. I've always loved the Uncharted Series (I even have a replica of Drake's ring on my keychain!) and wanted to pay homage to some of the classic elements of the games. All of the pixel art in this mini game is original (drawn by me!), but the concept and artwork is entirely inspired by Naughty Dog's 'Uncharted: Drake's Fortune' game design.
  The game is based off of the classic 'shoot out' segments from the Uncharted Series; upon entering a certain area, 'bad guys' appear from all sides where Nate is left to fend them off before proceeding to the next area. The player is usually provided with generous amounts of ammo, guns, and coverage scattered around the zone, and this minigame is essentially a little snippet of one of those scenes. 

# Game Structure
  The player maneuvers an 8-bit Nate figure behind a stone wall as 'bad guys' appear at random to shoot at him. Like in the original game, Nate has the options to crouch behind the wall to avoid damage, as the more consecutive damage he takes will decrease his 'luck'--too much damage, and the game will end. Nate also has a limited amount of ammo (100 bullets) that are divided into 5 segments of 20; if his ammo runs out, Nate will have to take cover to reload, or else he'll end up taking a lot of damage.
# Extras
  Another one of my favorite parts of the original series was looking through Nate's journal and reading his comments, looking through the drawings, and admiring the amount of thought, humor, and design that went into such a small part of the game. I've hidden a little easter egg in this mini game that just *might* reveal something similar ;)!
